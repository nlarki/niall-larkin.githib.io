The idea behind this website is to showcase the skills i have aquired throughout my bachelors degree, as well as those i have learned currently during my time as a data scientist.
I hope to add some of the blogs i have written in relation to numerous data science topics.
The project will be on the slow burner as i hope to make changes when i have time... 🕰️
